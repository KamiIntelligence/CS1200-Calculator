# CS1200 - Calculator

This is an abomination, which I probably deserve hell for creating.
In all truth, it is a calculator to test some algorithms we covered in our
CS1200 course. Mainly, base conversions, and factorial calculations.

#### TODO (in no order):
0. Do more than base ten to any base conversions.
1. Add an option to show work done by the calculator.
2. Clean the code.
3. Port to using GMP or something of the sort.
